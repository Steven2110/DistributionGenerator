# DistributionGenerator
Part of simulation laboratory assignment â„– 14. 

## Description
In this project we are creating an API to generate random variable using Poisson Distribution and Exponential distribution from [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library. Later the API will be used by [Bank Simulation Mobile App](https://github.com/Steven2110/BankSimulation) to generate random variable to simulate bank queueing system.
